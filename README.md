# CS50x Week 8 PSET - Homepage

This is my submission for [**CS50x Week 8's Homepage PSET**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/8/homepage/) where I created a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The site includes multiple pages:

- A main page with personal info and links
- A blog section with a search bar (JS feature)
- A “now” page inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)

> **Note:** The blog section currently uses placeholder content. I haven’t started writing actual posts yet, it's mainly there to demonstrate layout and interactivity for now.
